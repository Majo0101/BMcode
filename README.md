# BMCODE - Personal CV

Welcome to the official repository for BMCODE, my personal online CV crafted using Vue.js. This site is not only a demonstration of my technical skills but also an interactive portfolio that represents my professional journey and achievements.

## About the Website

BMCODE serves as a digital curriculum vitae, designed to highlight my expertise and projects in a dynamic and engaging manner. Built with Vue.js, this platform showcases how cutting-edge web technologies can be leveraged to create a personal and professional online presence. It's the perfect blend of functionality and aesthetics, designed to impress potential employers and networking contacts.

## Key Technologies

- **Vue.js:** Provides a component-based architecture that enhances the CV with a smooth and interactive user experience.
- **jQuery:** Utilized for DOM manipulations.
- **i18n:** Integrates internationalization to support multiple languages on the CV, making it accessible to a global audience.
- **jQuery with PHP:** Uses AJAX to call a PHP script, handling form data submission securely and sending messages directly to an email address without page refresh.
